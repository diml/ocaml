This directory contains tests to check that OCaml values are correctly
passed between OCaml and C when a primitive takes some or all of its
arguments unboxed/untagged and/or return its result unboxed/untagged.

To test one primitive we do:
- write all its argument and expected result in buffer A
- call the C external using arguments read from buffer A
- the C function write all the arguments it receive into buffer B
- the C function read the result from buffer A and returns it
- on the OCaml side we write the received result into buffer B
- the test is successful if A and B have the same contents

We construct the set of primitives to test as follow:
- all combination of normal/unboxed/untagged for functions taking up
  to 3 arguments (with more than 3 ocamlopt takes a really long time
  to compile the test files)
- a bunch of manual tests with functions taking more than 3 arguments.
  The list is [Gen_test.manual_tests]

We test the set of primitives a thousand times, with different random
data each time.
