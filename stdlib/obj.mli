    The same goes for [set_double_field] and [set_tag].  However, for
    [set_tag], in the case of immutable blocks where the middle-end optimizers
    never see code that discriminates on their tag (for example records), the
    operation should be safe.  Such uses are nonetheless discouraged.

    For experts only:
    [set_field] et al can be made safe by first wrapping the block in
    [Sys.opaque_identity], so any information about its contents will not
    be propagated.

module Pointer : sig
  (** Operations on raw pointers.

      This module provides operations on pointers, which represent raw machine
      addresses.  Any external pointer can be stored in a nativeint and
      presented back to external code.  Furthermore, pointers can be
      dereferenced, yielding the contents of the memory location they point to.

      It is almost always a very bad idea to expose pointers in library module
      interfaces -- they are intended for FFI work, such as accessing C data
      structures from OCaml without copying.  Libraries that use pointers
      should use them only to access data allocated by foreign allocators.

      Most users should not use pointers directly.  They are intended for use
      by higher-level libraries (such as ocaml-ctypes) as a faster alternative
      to C externals for accessing individual words of foreign data structures.

      If you control where the data is allocated, use the {!Bigarray} module
      instead, or use other libraries that provide safe abstractions.  The
      {!Bigarray} module ensures that the data lives as long as the bigarray is
      alive, and that it is freed when no longer accessible by OCaml code.
      Like raw pointers, the data contained in a bigarray can be accessed by
      other code without copying.

      Other libraries that provide higher-level functionality for manipulating
      foreign data include ocaml-ctypes and cstruct.

      Pointers are {e highly} unsafe.  There is no check (and indeed no way to
      check) that a pointer actually points to the location in memory that it
      claims to.  In fact, pointers are even less safe than C pointers, because
      OCaml pointers are untyped, while C pointers are typed. It is the
      responsibilty of any code that uses pointers to ensure that such use is
      safe, even given invalid or malicious input.  If you fail to do so, you
      will get a crash at best.  If the process is processing untrusted data,
      a misuse of pointers is likely to result in corruption of memory that
      allows for an attacker to execute arbitrary code.  Note that this applies
      to the rest of the {!Obj} module as well.
